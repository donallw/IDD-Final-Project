## The Automated Pill Dispenser 
The main idea is to create an automated pill dispenser that selects the correct pills and correct quantities based on the day of the week. When someone approaches the pill dispenser, it will detect their face and greet them. Then, based on the day of the week and the individual involved, it will retrieve the respective pills. This will help solve the problem of polypharmacy many users face that are under a variety of medication.

## Cardboard Prototyping

###  Design 1

After considering all design methods discussed above we selected the 2nd prototype design to observe further. We created a cardboard prototype that uses a turstile mechanism to deliver the pills. the prototype is demonstrated in the video below.

##### Releasing pills

As mentioned above we implemented a turnstile mechanism with cardboard and the servos to release pills. The video below shows how the prototype uses this mechanis to release the pills when the button is pressed.
