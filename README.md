## The Automated Pill Dispenser 
The main idea is to create an automated pill dispenser that selects the correct pills and correct quantities based on the day of the week. When someone approaches the pill dispenser, it will detect their face and greet them. Then, based on the day of the week and the individual involved, it will retrieve the respective pills. This will help solve the problem of polypharmacy many users face that are under a variety of medication.
